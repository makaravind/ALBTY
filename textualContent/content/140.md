Javascript Jazz ⚡⚡️
### Private class fields (Stage 3 proposal)
#### Similar feature is already available in Typescript.

```js
class incrementCounter {
#count = 0;
increment() {
this.#count++;
}
}
```

**Notice the # in front of _count_? It denotes that count is a private field**

```js
incrementCounter.#count // -> syntax error
```

Similarly, private class methods can also be created.
