## That Thing ⚡️⚡️
### Vibration API

- Most modern mobile devices include vibration hardware, which lets software code provide physical feedback to the user by causing the device to shake. 
- The Vibration API offers Web apps the ability to access this hardware, if it exists, and does nothing if the device doesn't support it.

 ```javascript 
 window.navigator.vibrate(200);
window.navigator.vibrate([200]);
  ```
