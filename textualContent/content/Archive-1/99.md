## Recommended Secure coding - Canonicalize path names before validating them

The user can specify a file outside the intended directory by entering an argument that contains ../ sequences. Which is a valid path in a directory in linux.

File.getCanonicalPath() method, introduced in Java 2, which fully resolves the argument and constructs a canonicalized path. Special file names such as dot dot (..) are also removed so that the input is reduced to a canonicalized form before validation is carried out. An attacker cannot use ../ sequences to break out of the specified directory when the validate() method is present. 

For example, the path /img/../etc/passwd resolves to /etc/passwd.
