### Worst Exception Handling Practices - Swallowing Exceptions

If your intention is to simply satisfy the compiler, you can easily do so by swallowing the exception:

 ```java
public void parseFile(String filePath) {  
    try {
        // some code that forms an exception
    } catch (Exception ex) {}
}
 ```

Swallowing an exception refers to the act of catching an exception and not fixing the issue.

All the relevant useful information that we could extract from the exception for debugging is lost, and we didn't do anything to recover from this exceptional condition.

Another very common practice is to simply print out the stack trace of the exception:

 ```java
public void parseFile(String filePath) {  
    try {
        // some code that forms an exception
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
}
 ```
This approach forms an illusion of handling. Yes, while it is better than simply ignoring the exception, by printing out the relevant information, this doesn't handle the exceptional condition any more than ignoring it does.
