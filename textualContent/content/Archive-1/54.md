## Web API's ⚡️⚡️
### Page Visibility API
 ```javascript 
function handleVisibilityChange() {
  if (document.hidden) {
    pauseSimulation();
  } else  {
    startSimulation();
  }
}

document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", handleVisibilityChange, false);
  ```

## Use cases
1. An application showing a dashboard of information doesn't want to poll the server for updates when the page isn't visible
2. A page wants to detect when it is being prerendered so it can keep accurate count of page views
3. A site wants to switch off sounds when a device is in standby mode (user pushes power button to turn screen off)
