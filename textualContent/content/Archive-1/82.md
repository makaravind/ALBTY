## Stylish CSS ⚡⚡️
### Specificity

```css
p {
  color: red
}

p {
  color: blue
}
```

Since the CSS sheet is read from top to bottom. Only the second style is applied. All the P elements gets blue color.

This behaviour can be modified by adding more specific selectors like classes and Ids.

```css
p.specificClass {
  color: red
}

p {
  color: blue
}
```

Now, The P with 'specificClass' class gets the red color and rest blue color. This property if called specificity.

Following the increasing order of specificity

 ```javascript 
 /* 
    *[wild-card] (0) < tag selector(1) < class(10) < ID(100) < inline-styles(1000)
  */
  ```
