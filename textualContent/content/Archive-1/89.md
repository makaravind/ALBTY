 ```java
public String readFirstLine(String url) throws FileNotFoundException {  
    try {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(url));
        return scanner.nextLine();
    } catch(FileNotFoundException ex) {
        throw ex; 
    }
}
 ```
try-with-resources Statement
The previously complex and verbose block can be substituted with:


 ```java 
 
static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {  
    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
        return br.readLine();
    }
}
 ```

This way, you don't have to concern yourself with closing the resources yourself, as the try-with-resources block ensures that the resources will be closed upon the end of the statement.
