## Create React App 2.0
It brings a year’s worth of improvements in a single dependency update. Here’s a short summary of what’s new in this release:
•	More styling options: you can use Sass and CSS Modules out of the box.
•	Updated to Babel 7, including support for the React fragment syntax and many bugfixes.
•	Updated to webpack 4, which automatically splits JS bundles more intelligently.
•	Updated to Jest 23, which includes an interactive mode for reviewing snapshots.
•	Added PostCSS so you can use new CSS features in old browsers.
•	You can use Apollo, Relay Modern, MDX, and other third-party Babel Macros transforms.
•	You can now import an SVG as a React component, and use it in JSX.
•	You can try the experimental Yarn Plug’n’Play mode that removes node_modules.
•	You can now plug your own proxy implementation in development to match your backend API.
