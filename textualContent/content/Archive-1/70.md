Have you ever been told that adding a method to an object’s prototype is a bad practice?

because that property will now be present in for...in loops? Or that you always need to use Object.hasOwnProperty() when enumerating properties? 

I know I’ve read that advice dozens of times, but usually without an explanation why. The reason it’s not good practice to simply add a property to an object’s prototype is that the property will be enumerable by default. By specifically setting this property to false it then becomes safe.

Bad 👎
 ```javascript  
 
 const proto = {}
const obj = { ok: 1 }
obj.__proto__ = proto
for (let key in obj) console.log(key) // [ok]

proto.bad = () => 42

for (let key in obj) console.log(key) // [ok,bad]
for (let key in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(key) // [ok]
  }
}
  ```


good 👍
 ```javascript 
 const proto = {}
const obj = { ok: 1 }
obj.__proto__ = proto
for (let key in obj) console.log(key) // [ok]

// define method using this syntax
Object.defineProperty(proto, 'good', {
  value: () => 42,
  enumerable: false
})

for (let key in obj) console.log(key) // [ok]
  ```
