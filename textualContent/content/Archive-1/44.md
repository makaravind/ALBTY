### Client-Side Caching - browser

People across the country (or the world) can get responses quickly through CDN. There’s just one issue — they have no way to store it. Your customers still need to request for the resources incase of refresh.

The solution? Client-Side Caching

Separate location for storing static assets since it is on the client-side, or on the same computer as the browser.

This is great for sites like Facebook or Amazon that you might frequently visit. It’s great for their server costs too, since they can reduce the number of requests they need to handle.

How does your browser know when to request new files from the server? Otherwise, you would never experience updated versions of these local files. Well, just like milk producers put a date on their milk packaging, servers will add some sort of identifier within the HTTP response header.
