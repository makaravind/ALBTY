### Difference between c and go arrays

Go's arrays are values. An array variable denotes the entire array; it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case in C). This means that when you assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents. 

note: To avoid the copy you could pass a pointer to the array, but then that's a pointer to an array, not an array.
