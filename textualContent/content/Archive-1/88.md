### Check out this code snippet!

 ```java
public File getFile(String url) throws FileNotFoundException {  
    // some code
    throw new FileNotFoundException();
}
 ```

No return ? still a valid java code! here is how...

We are required to mark our method signature with a throws clause. A method can add as many exceptions as needed in its throws clause, and can throw them later on in the code, but doesn't have to. This method doesn't require a return statement, even though it defines a return type. This is because it throws an exception by default, which ends the flow of the method abruptly. The return statement, therefore, would be unreachable and cause a compilation error.
