### Best Exception Handling Practices  - 1

Avoid Exceptional Conditions
Sometimes, by using simple checks, we can avoid an exception forming altogether:

 ```java
public Employee getEmployee(int i) {  
    Employee[] employeeArray = {new Employee("David"), new Employee("Rhett"), new 
        Employee("Scott")};

    if(i >= employeeArray.length) {
        System.out.println("Index is too high!");
        return null;
    } else {
        System.out.println("Employee found: " + employeeArray[i].name);
        return employeeArray[i];
    }
  }
}

 ```
Calling this method with a valid index would result in:

Employee found: Scott  
But calling this method with an index that's out of bounds would result in:

Index is too high!  
In any case, even though the index is too high, the offending line of code will not execute and no exception will arise.
