## Audio On Web ⚡️⚡️
### Creating your HTMLAudioElement entirely in javascript

 ```javascript 
var flush = new Audio('toilet_flush.wav');
flush.play(); 
  ```

Some of the more commonly used properties of the audio element includes 
**src, currentTime, duration, paused, muted and volume**.

 ```javascript 
 var flush = new Audio('toilet_flush.wav');
flush.addEventListener('loadeddata',() => {
    var duration = flush.duration; // the duration variable now holds the duration (in seconds) of the audio clip  
})
  ```
