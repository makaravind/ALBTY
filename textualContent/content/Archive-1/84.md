## Immediately Invoked Async Function Expressions

### Sometimes, it’d be nice if you could use await at the top level of a module or script. Alas, it’s only available inside async functions. You therefore have several options.

You can either create an async function main() and call it immediately afterwards:

 ```javascript 
 
 async function main() {
    console.log(await asyncFunction());
}
main();
  ```

Or you can use an Immediately Invoked Async Function Expression:

 ```javascript 
 (async function () {
    console.log(await asyncFunction());
})();
  ```

Another option is an Immediately Invoked Async Arrow Function:

 ```javascript 
 (async () => {
    console.log(await asyncFunction());
})();
  ```
