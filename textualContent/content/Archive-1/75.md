## Javascript Gym ⚡⚡️

### Whenever you have a method that is specific to a class itself, but doesn’t need to be shared across instances of that class, you can add it as a static property of the class.

 ```javascript 
 class Animal {
  constructor(name, energy) {
    this.name = name
    this.energy = energy
  }
  eat(amount) {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`)
    this.energy += amount
  }
  sleep() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is sleeping.`)
    this.energy += length
  }
  play() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is playing.`)
    this.energy -= length
  }
  static nextToEat(animals) {
    const sortedByLeastEnergy = animals.sort((a,b) => {
      return a.energy - b.energy
    })

    return sortedByLeastEnergy[0].name
  }
}
  ```

  Now, because we added nextToEat as a static property on the class, it lives on the Animal class itself (not its prototype)
