 ## Hot HTML ⚡️⚡️
 
 ```javascript 
 <article
  id="electriccars"
  data-columns="3"
  data-index-number="12314"
  data-parent="cars">
...
</article>
  ```

  HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard,

to get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are converted to camelCase).

### Issues
1. The main issues to consider are Internet Explorer support and performance. Internet Explorer 11+ provides support for the standard, but all earlier versions do not support dataset. To support IE 10 and under you need to access data attributes with getAttribute() instead. 
2. Also, the performance of reading data-attributes compared to storing this data in a regular JS object is poor.
