## JavaScript Gym

JavaScript doesn't specify anything about I/O in its spec. That's defined by the host environment.

for example, setTimeout isn't in the JavaScript source code. setTimeout is provided by the JavaScript engine. It is part of the browser or part of node and not part of JavaScript itself.
