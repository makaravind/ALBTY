### Property descriptors - Writable and Configurable

While value and enumerable deal with reading properties, writable and configurable deal with writing properties

If a property has writable set to false then that property’s value cannot be reassigned another value.

 If a property has configurable set to false then it cannot be deleted and it cannot have its property descriptor changed again.


  ```javascript 
  const obj = Object.defineProperty({}, 'foo', {
  value: 'hello',
  writable: false, // reassignable?
  configurable: false // deletable/redefinable?
})
obj.foo = 'bye'
console.log(obj.foo) // 'hello'
delete obj.foo
console.log(obj.foo) // 'hello'
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {
  value: 1
}) // TypeError: Cannot redefine property: foo
  
   ```
