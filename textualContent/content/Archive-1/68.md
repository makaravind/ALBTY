### Performance on Javascript(ES6)
While one can add as many dynamically named properties to an Object as they like, for performance and security reasons it’s better to use a **Map**

Since objects as “complex” key/value stores, Each property has meta information tied to it, interactions require lookups in the prototype chain, etc. These each have performance considerations and may not be beneficial to your particular situation which is again why a **Map** is often better for dynamic collections of data.
