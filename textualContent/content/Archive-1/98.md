Recommended Secure coding - Normalize strings before validating them

first things first, is Normalization different form validations? Yes

"Normalization is important because in Unicode, the same string can have many different representations. According to the Unicode Standard [Davis 2008], annex #15"

"...The most suitable normalization form for performing input validation on arbitrarily encoded strings is KC (NFKC) ."

For example in Java, The Normalizer.normalize() method transforms Unicode text into the standard normalization forms described in Unicode Standard Annex #15 Unicode Normalization Forms.
```java
 
// Normalize
s = Normalizer.normalize(s, Form.NFKC);

```
