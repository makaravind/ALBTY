n general, the concept of service in enterprise applications is vague, but in the context of a Spring application, a service is any class that provides methods to interact with domain logic or external components without maintaining state that changes the overall behavior of the service. For example, a service may act on behalf of an application to obtain documents from a database or obtain data from an external REST API.

```java
@Service
public class FooService {}
```

In practice, @Service and @Component are often used interchangeably due to the all-encompassing definition of a service.
