## Git and OS line ending ⚡⚡️
windows line ending is different from the Linux file line ending. If you ever come across an error where when you clone a git repo and your vim editor shouts that ^M is not valid.

Just remember to set git automatic line ending conversion using the following command before cloning.

```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

> #120
