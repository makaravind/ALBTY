```java

Observable<Integer> ints =
        Observable.create(subscriber -> {
                    log("Create");
                    subscriber.onNext(42);
                    subscriber.onCompleted();
                }
        );
log("Starting");
ints.subscribe(i -> log("Element A: " + i));
ints.subscribe(i -> log("Element B: " + i));
log("Exit");

/*
main: Starting
main: Create
main: Element A: 42
main: Create
main: Element B: 42
main: Exit
*/
```

cache() does is stand between subscribe() and our custom Observable. When the first subscriber appears, cache() delegates subscription to the underlying Observable and forwards all notifications (events, completions, or errors) downstream. However, at the same time, it keeps a copy of all notifications internally. When a subsequent subscriber wants to receive pushed notifications, cache() no longer delegates to the underlying Observable but instead feeds cached values. With caching, the output for two Subscribers is quite different:

```java
main: Starting
main: Create
main: Element A: 42
main: Element B: 42
main: Exit
```
