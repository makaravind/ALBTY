### Creating a simple **generator** in JS

Generator functions are a special kind of function in JavaScript which is declared with the _function*_ syntax. Generator functions are used to create iterator objects (ones with a .next() method) but in a much clearer and more concise way. 

Below is a finite generator that creates an equivalent iterator:

```javascript
const createIterator = function* () {
	let x = 0;
	while (x < 4) {
		yield x;
		x += 1;
	}
};
```
