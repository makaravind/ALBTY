tion, Spring provides the @Component annotation. Applying this annotation to class informs Spring that the class is a component and an object of this class can be instantiated and injected into another component. The @Component interface is applied to a class in the following manner:

		```java

		@Component
		public class FooComponent {}

		```
lthough the @Component annotation suffices to inform Spring of the injectability of a bean; Spring also provides specialized annotations that can be used to create components with more meaningful contextual information.
