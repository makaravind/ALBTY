Minimalism — The most undervalued development skill

onerror is a special browser event that fires whenever an uncaught JavaScript error has been thrown. It’s one of the easiest ways to log client-side errors and report them to your servers. It’s also one of the major mechanisms by which Sentry’s client JavaScript integration (raven-js) works.

```
window.onerror = function(msg, _path, line, column, error) {
  fetch('/errors', {
      error: error ? error.stack : '',
	column: column,
	line: line,
	msg: msg
	})
  return false
}

```
This is all we need. Works perfectly and gets the job done.

note: It is does not work in chrome console.
