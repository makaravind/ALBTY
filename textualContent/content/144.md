temporal sharding of relation dbs

sharding is taking a single logical data model and partitioning it into disjoint subsets, ideally so that relationships between records in the data model do not span a single "shard". In practice, a shard is often an independent database instance. A simple example would be sharding a database of people by last name such that names that start with "a" are on shard 1, "b" are on shard 2, etc. Distributed hash tables are a special case of sharding; all records can be sharded but there will be no common relationship between records on a particular shard.


This is a pretty common approach and one that has some real flaws:
Load balancing. Most of the old machines didn't get any traffic because people are interested in what is happening now, especially with Twitter. 
Expensive. They filled up one machine, with all its replication slaves, every three weeks, which is an expensive setup.
Logistically complicated. Building a whole new cluster every three weeks is a pain for the DBA team.
