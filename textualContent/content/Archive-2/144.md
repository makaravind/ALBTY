Database Sharding ⚡⚡️
Temporal sharding of relation DBs
Sharding is taking a single logical data model and partitioning it into disjoint subsets, ideally so that relationships between records in the data model do not span a single "shard".

In practice, a shard is often an independent database instance. A simple example would be sharding a database of people by the last name such that names that start with "a" are on shard 1, "b" are on shard 2, etc.

Distributed hash tables are a special case of sharding; all records can be sharded but there will be no common relationship between records on a particular shard.

Flaws:
Load balancing - Most of the old machines didn't get any traffic because people are interested in what is happening now, especially with Twitter. If data is sharded on poor fields.
Expensive - They filled up one machine, with all its replication slaves, every three weeks, which is an expensive setup.
Logistically complicated - Building a whole new cluster every three weeks is a pain for the DBA team.
