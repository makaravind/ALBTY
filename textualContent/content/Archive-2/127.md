Oracle - Conditional Sorting and Sorting By Function ⚡⚡️                                      
                                                                                                        
```

### How it works:                  
                                                                         
The selection of data for our results follows Oracle’s normal approach, so employee identifiers, last   
names, and so forth are fetched from the HR.EMPLOYEES table. For the purposes of ordering the data using
our CASE expression, Oracle performs additional calculations that aren’t shown in the results. All the  
candidate result rows that have a non-NULL commission value have the product of COMMISSION_PCT and      
SALARY calculated and then used to compare with the SALARY figures for all other employees for ordering 
purposes.
