## Oracle - Null

Oracle deviates from the SQL standard in implicitly treating an empty, zero-length string as a surrogate for NULL.

### NULL HAS NO EQUIVALENTS

No other value is same as NULL. not even NULL
Hence this would not work

```
select *
from hr.employees
where commission_pct = null
```

aLWAYs use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL
