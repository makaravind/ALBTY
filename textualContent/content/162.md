XOR linked list

 node in a singly linked list contains a value and a pointer to the next node. A node in a doubly linked list contains the same, plus a pointer to the previous node. But in fact it’s possible to do away with that extra storage requirement. Instead of storing either pointer directly, suppose we store the XOR’d value of the previous and next pointers


 ```
// traverse the list given either the head or
// the tail
void traverse( Node *endPoint )
{
  Node* prev = endPoint;
    Node* cur = endPoint;

      while ( cur )
        // loop until we reach a null pointer
	  {
	      printf( "value = %d\n", cur->value);
	          if ( cur == prev )
		      
		      // only true on first iteration
		            cur = cur->prevXorNext;
			          // move to next node in the list
				      else
				          {
					        Node* temp = cur;
						      cur = (Node*)((uintptr_t)prev
						               ^ (uintptr_t)cur->prevXorNext);
							             // move to next node in the list
								           prev = temp;
									       }
									         }
										 }
										 	

 ```
