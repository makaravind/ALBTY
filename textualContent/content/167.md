java Nested Class
A nested class refers to the idea of defining one class inside another class. The scope of the nested class is bounded by the scope of the enclosing classes. That means if Pearl is a class defined within, say, the Oyster class, the object of Pearl cannot exist without the existence of an Oyster object and the class within the class, Pearl, can access all the members of the Oyster class, including private members. But, the external class, such as Oyster, cannot access the members of Pearl class.

Now, the nested class can be of two types, a static nested class and a non-static nested class. A nested class, Pearl, which is declared static with the static modifier, cannot access the members of the enclosing class Oyster directly because the nested class Pearl is now static. As a result, it needs an object of the Oyster class to access the members of its enclosing class. Static nested classes are very rarely used.
