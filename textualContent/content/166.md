this is a very interesting read on how bioinformatics and AI is evolving.

snippets from article:
"In a recent debate between Gary Marcus and Yoshua Bengio about the future of Artificial Intelligence, the question came up of how much information the genome can encode. This relates to the idea of how much innate or prior “knowledge” human beings are really born with, versus what we learn through experience. This is a hot topic in AI these days as people debate how much prior knowledge needs to be pre-wired into AI systems, in order to get them to achieve something more akin to natural intelligence."
" Being amazed that you can make a human with only 20,000 genes is thus like being amazed that Shakespeare could write all those plays with only 26 letters. It’s totally missing where the actual, meaningful information is and how it is decoded. "
